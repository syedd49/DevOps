*.Apache Mesos: is a orchestration engine for container.
*.Marathon is a framework for docker runtime images.

*.Key Concepts:
  - Namespace: Partitationing different projects 
  - Pods: isolated process/PID namespace
          root filesystem namespace
          user namespace
          network namespace
          hostname/uts namespace
          volumes
*. Kubenetes Follows SPECS
       A pi version
       K ind (entity)
       M etadata (Label)
       S pec (similar to docker compose)
*. Replication Controllers:
      Control loop to monitoring ( it works through Labelling )
      Replication Controllers (works for A and B and C) v/s replicaSet ( works for A or B or C) 
      replicaset + update stratergies = Deployment
*. Service Discovery:
      Services works on SPEC with labels and selectors
      connects to end points with selectors.
      Service has constant identifier is CLUSTER IP (it never changes)
