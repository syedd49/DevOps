Replica Sets in Action


If you are not running a monitoring screen, start it in a new terminal with the following command.

watch -n 1 kubectl get  pod,deploy,rs,svc
kubectl delete pod vote


kubectl apply -f vote-rs.yaml --dry-run
 
kubectl apply -f vote-rs.yaml
 
kubectl get rs
 
kubectl describe rs vote
 
kubectl get pods
 
 
Exercise :

Switch to monitoring screen, observe how many replicas were created and why

Compare selectors and labels of the pods created with and without replica sets

kubectl get pods
 
kubectl get pods --show-labels
Exercise: Deploying new version of the application
kubectl edit rs/vote
Update the version of the image from schoolofdevops/vote:v1 to schoolofdevops/vote:v2

Save the file. Observe if application got updated. Note what do you observe. Do you see the new version deployed ??

Exercise: Self Healing Replica Sets
List the pods and kill some of those, see what replica set does.

kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pods  vote-xxxx  vote-yyyy
where replace xxxx and yyyy with actual pod ids.

Questions:

Did replica set replaced the pods ?

Which version of the application is running now ?

Lets now delete the pod created independent of replica set.

kubectl get pods
kubectl delete pods  vote
Observe what happens.

  * Does replica set take any action after deleting the pod created outside of its spec ? Why?
